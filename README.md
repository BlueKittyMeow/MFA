"What a thing to happen to a little boy"


## "What a Thing to Happen" - Project Summary

**Core Concept**: An older man in an MFA program desperately performs youth, unable to access his real experience for his writing due to terror of aging/mortality. His emotional development was frozen by childhood trauma (think *A Separate Peace*). He has one friend, Max, a genuinely young student who sees him clearly and treats him with unusual compassion.

**The Meta Twist**: The entire narrative is actually Max's thesis project - we've been reading Max's version of his friend's interior life. This is revealed when Max presents his work for critique, reading the opening lines we've already read. The old man's horrific recognition triggers a formal breakdown of the text itself - different fonts, fractured narrative, his real voice finally breaking through Max's interpretation.

**Literary Themes**: Who owns whose story? The ethics of using others as material. How well can we know someone's interior life? The relationship between artistic compassion and exploitation. The tragedy of self-deception preventing authentic expression.

**Structure**: 70-80k words, building to formal/textual breakdown. The unreliable narration works on multiple levels - first as the old man's self-deception, then as Max's potentially patronizing interpretation.

**One-Line Pitch**: "An aging MFA student's desperate performance of youth becomes his younger classmate's thesis project in this nested narrative that questions who has the right to tell whose story."


**Longer Pitch**: "What the reader experiences as the interior life of an aging MFA student struggling to connect with his younger classmates is revealed to be his fellow MFA student Max's creative thesis project - a written simulation of his consciousness. When the betrayal is exposed, the older man's desperate marginalia scrawled across Max's text becomes a devastating exploration of artistic ethics, forcing both characters and readers to confront the morality of transforming human pain into art."
