# MFA Project Notes - "What a Thing to Happen"

## Core Concept
**Nested double-unreliable narrator**: An older MFA student's story is actually his younger friend Max's thesis project. The revelation triggers formal breakdown via marginalia as the real narrator reclaims his voice.

**Target Length**: 70k words

## Structure

### Part 1 (1/3 to 1/2 of novel)
- Standard third-person narrative following the older narrator
- MFA program setting, daily life, workshop attendance
- Friendship with Max (who seems unusually interested/compassionate)
- Narrator's social struggles, sense of not fitting in with younger cohort
- **Key constraint**: Avoid workshop scenes where both narrator and Max appear together (would create faculty recognition problems in Max's thesis)

### Part 2 (Revelation + Marginalia)
- Max presents thesis OR shares draft with narrator
- **Structural innovation**: Repetition of Part 1 events, but now as Max's written thesis
- Narrator's voice erupts in marginalia: corrections, fury, recognition, eventual pity
- Visual breakdown: marginalia escalating from corrections to emotional scrawl, X-ed out pages
- **Event horizon**: Max's betrayal destroys his ability to continue observing; narrator reclaims voice ownership in marginalia. 

## Character Dynamics

### The Narrator (Older MFA Student)
- **Not delusional**: Aware of his age, understands social dynamics
- Childhood trauma froze emotional development (*A Separate Peace* resonance)
- Cannot access authentic experience for writing due to mortality terror
- Isolated but not necessarily pathetic - more melancholy and self-conscious than Max's interpretation suggests

### Max (Young MFA Student)
- **Desperate for thesis material**: Previous work discarded, program deadline looming
- Friendship begins as genuine but becomes opportunistic research
- **His own pathetic figure**: Using exploitation to avoid creative risk-taking

### Faculty/Cohort

- Max can present thesis as "fictional character study" without obvious real-life parallels
- Age blending more common in MFA programs, but narrator still feels isolated

## Key Themes
- **Ethics of artistic material**: Who owns whose story?
- **Mutual pathetic reflection**: "Two pathetic people holding mirrors up to one another on their shoulders in place of heads"
- **Voice ownership**: Marginalia as reclaiming authentic expression
- **Academic exploitation**: Success built on betrayal of trust

## Marginalia Evolution
2. **Direct contradictions**: "I NEVER thought this" / "This isn't how it happened"
3. **Recognition of patterns**: "You asked about this for thesis, not because you cared"
4. **Self-awareness**: "Is this really how I seem?"
5. **Understanding Max**: You always were a bit of a jerk, weren't you? A bit at elbows length. 
6. **Final pity**: "Afraid? It is a bit horrific, isn't it. "At least I know what I am"

## Intertextual Elements
- **Prufrock**: "Do I dare disturb the universe?" - narrator finally does, through marginalia
- **Yeats "The Old Men Admiring Themselves in the Water"**: Max studying aging/creative failure
- Possible Eliot/Yeats dialogue: "hands like claws" to "ragged claws"

## Technical Considerations
- **Re-reading experience**: First section gains new meaning after revelation
- **Max's consequences**: Likely gets away with it professionally if compartmentalization successful

## Key Lines/Moments
- "You had much better work if you had kept at it, did you have to pathologize someone else? Pathologize yourself"
- The moment of recognition when Max shares the thesis
- Narrator's choice not to denounce Max - dignity through pity rather than revenge

## Potential Opening
Needs subtle suggestion this is "text" rather than pure interiority without tipping the reveal. Possibly slight over-crafted quality suggesting observation rather than lived experience.
